Connect your [Preact] components up to that address bar.

`preact-router` provides a `<Router />` component that conditionally renders its children when the URL matches their `path`. It also includes a convenient `<Link />` component as a drop-in replacement for `<a />` wired up to the router.

### Usage Example

```js
import Router from 'preact-router';
import { h } from 'preact';
/** @jsx h */

const Main = () => (
	<Router>
		<Home path="/" />
		<About path="/about" />
		<Search path="/search/:query" />
	</Router>
);

render(<Main />, document.body);
```


### Handling URLS

:information_desk_person: Pages are just regular components that get mounted when you navigate to a certain URL.
Any URL parameters get passed to the component as `props`.

Defining what component(s) to load for a given URL is easy and declarative.
You can even mix-and-match URL parameters and normal `props`.

```js
<Router>
  <A path="/" />
  <B path="/b" id="42" />
  <C path="/c/:id" />
</Router>
```
